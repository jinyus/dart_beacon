# 0.45.1

-   [Dependency] Updated `lite_ref` to `0.8.1`

# 0.45.0

-   [Feat] Add `ValueNotifier.toBeacon()` which converts a `ValueNotifier` to a `WritableBeacon`. All changes to the notifier are reflected in the beacon and vice versa.
-   [Feat] Add `TextEditingBeacon` which is a beacon that wraps a `TextEditingController`. All changes to the controller are reflected in the beacon and vice versa.

    ## lite_ref (0.7.0):

    -   [Breaking] The `overrides` property of `LiteRefScope` is now a `Set<ScopedRef>` instead of a `List<ScopedRef>`.

# 0.44.5

-   [Fix] Fix bug with `FutureBeacon`s not autosleeping
-   [Feat] Expose list of beacons created in a BeaconGroup wuth `BeaconGroup.beacons`
-   [Feat] Add `BeaconGroup.onCreate` to allow adding a callback to be run when a beacon is created

# 0.44.4

-   [Fix] Rare bug in FutureBeacon when start is called multiple times synchronously.

# 0.44.3

-   [Feat] Add `FutureBeacon.idle()` to set a beacon to the `AsyncIdle` state.

# 0.44.2

-   [Feat] Add the ability for widgets to observe beacons synchronously. When `synchronous` is true, `autobatching` will be disabled and all updates will be emitted immediately.
    ```dart
    final beacon = Beacon.writable(10);
    beacon.observe(context, (prev, next) {}, synchronous: true);
    ```
-   [Dependency] Updated `lite_ref` to `0.6.3`

# 0.44.1

-   [Refactor] Internal refactor
-   [Dependency] Updated `lite_ref` to `0.6.2`

# 0.44.0

-   [Breaking] The `beacons` getter for `Beacon.family` has been replaced with `entries`. This is a breaking change because it returns a `MapEntry<Key,Beacon>` instead of a `Beacon`.

-   [Dependency] Updated `lite_ref` to `0.6.1`

# 0.43.0

-   [Fix] Update lite_ref dependency and add flutter dependency constraint

# 0.42.1

-   [Fix] Export PeriodicBeacon and BeaconFamily classes

# 0.42.0

-   [Breaking] `resetIfError` option for `toFuture()` is now `true` by default. This was done because there's rarely a case where you'd want it to throw instantly. If you want to keep the previous value, set `resetIfError` to `false`.

# 0.41.3

-   [Docs] Update README

# 0.41.2

-   [Feat] Export `lite_ref` as the recommended dependency injection mechanism for state_beacon. Added convenience methods to `ScopedRef` for `BeaconController`s and `Beacon`s

    ```dart
    class CountController extends BeaconController {
        late final count = B.writable(0);
        late final doubledCount = B.derived(() => count.value * 2);
    }

    final countControllerRef = Ref.scoped((ctx) => CountController());

    class CounterText extends StatelessWidget {
        const CounterText({super.key});

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            // watch the count beacon and return its value
            final count = countControllerRef.select(context, (c) => c.count);
            return Text('$count');
        }
    }
    ```

# 0.41.1

-   [Refactor] Move `BeaconController` to `state_beacon_core` package

# 0.41.0

-   [Feat] Add `Beacon.periodic` that emits values periodically.

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i + 1);

    final nextFive = await myBeacon.buffer(5).next();

    expect(nextFive, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
    ```

-   [Breaking] `FutureBeacon.toFuture()` now returns immediately when it's not in the loading state. This is breaking because in previous versions, it would wait for the next update before returning the value. This was a bug! To get the next state you can use `.next()`.
-   [Feat] `FutureBeacon.toFuture()` now has a `resetIfError` option that will reset the beacon if the current state is `AsyncError`.

# 0.40.0

-   [Feat] Add `BeaconController` for use in Flutter. see [docs](https://github.com/jinyus/dart_beacon/blob/main/packages/state_beacon/README.md#beaconcontroller)
-   [Feat] Implement `Disposable` from [basic_interfaces](https://pub.dev/packages/basic_interfaces) package which makes it autodispsable when used with the [lite_ref](https://pub.dev/packages/lite_ref) package.
-   [Docs] Add section on `testing` to the README.
-   [Feat] Add `synchronous` option to wrap and chaining methods. This defaults to `true` which means that wrapper beacons will get all updates.
-   [Breaking] Duration is now a positional argument for chaining methods `yourBeacon.debounce()`, `yourBeacon.throttle()`, `yourBeacon.bufferTime()`. This was done to make the code more concise.

    -   Old:

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    myBeacon.debounce(duration: k10ms);
    myBeacon.throttle(duration: k10ms);
    myBeacon.bufferTime(duration: k10ms);
    ```

    -   New:

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    myBeacon.debounce(k10ms);
    myBeacon.throttle(k10ms);
    myBeacon.bufferTime(k10ms);
    ```

-   [Deprecation] `yourBeacon.stream` is now `yourBeacon.toStream()`. This was done to allow auto-batching configuration. By default, auto-batching is enabled. You can disable it by setting `synchronous` to `true`.

    -   Old:

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    myBeacon.stream;
    ```

    -   New:

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    myBeacon.toStream();
    ```

# 0.39.1

-   Minor refactor to improve performance.
-   Add `BeaconObserver.useLogging()` as an alias to `BeaconObserver.instance = LoggingObserver()`.
-   Reduce sdk constraint to ^3.0.0 from ^3.1.5

# 0.39.0

-   [Breaking] Beacons will no longer be reset when disposed. It will keep its current value.
-   [Breaking] Writing to a disposed beacon will throw an error. Reading will print a warning to the console in debug mode. A beacon should only be disposed if you have no more use for it. If you want to reuse a beacon, use the `reset` method instead.

    ```dart
    final a = Beacon.writable(10);
    a.dispose();
    a.value = 20; // throws an error
    print(a.value); // prints 10
    ```

-   [Breaking] When a beacon is disposed, all downstream derived beacons and effects will be disposed as well.

    ```dart
    final a = Beacon.writable(10);
    final b = Beacon.writable(10);
    final c = Beacon.derived(() => a.value * b.value);

    a.subscribe((_) {});

    Beacon.effect(
        () {
        c.value;
        },
        name: 'effect',
    );

    //...//

    a.dispose();

    // "c" is watching "a" so it is disposed
    // the effect is watching "c" so it is disposed
    //
    // a   b
    // |  /
    // | /
    // c
    // |
    // effect

    expect(a.isDisposed, true);
    expect(c.isDisposed, true);
    // effect is also disposed
    ```

# 0.38.0

-   [Feat] Add methods to `Beacon.streamRaw` that operates on the internal stream: `unsubscribe` `pause` and `resume`.
-   [Feat] `onDispose` now returns a function that can be used to unregister the dispose listener.
-   [Breaking] `anybeacon.next()` no longer takes a timeout parameter. It will also throw an error if called on a lazy beacon and the beacon is disposed before emitting a value; unless a [fallback] value is provided.

Removed Deprecated methods:
`anybeacon.toStream()` is now removed. Use `anybeacon.stream` instead.

# 0.37.0

-   [Breaking] Remove `unsubscribe` method from `Beacon.streamRaw`
-   [Fix] Bug when using Flutter scheduler where effects were not running before `runApp` was called.
-   [Refactor] Internal refactor

# 0.36.0

-   [Breaking] `Beacon.stream` and `Beacon.streamRaw` will now autosleep when they have no more listeners. This is a breaking change because it changes the default behavior. If you want to keep the old behavior, set `shouldSleep` to false.

They will unsubscribe from the stream when sleeping and resubscribe when awoken. For `Beacon.stream`, it will enter the loading state when awoken. It is recommended to use the default when using services like Firebase to prevent cost overruns.

# 0.35.0

-   [Breaking] The filter function is now required when chaining the filtered beacon.

### old:

```dart
final count = Beacon.writable(10);
final filtered = count.filter(filter: (prev, next) => next.isEven);
```

### new:

```dart
final count = Beacon.writable(10);
final filtered = count.filter((prev, next) => next.isEven);
```

# 0.34.4

-   Internal refactor

# 0.34.3

-   [Feat] Add `map` to chaining methods

```dart
final count = Beacon.writable(10);
final mapped = count.map((value) => value * 2);

expect(mapped.value, 20);

count.value = 20;

expect(count.value, 20);
expect(mapped.value, 40);
```

```dart
final stream = Stream.periodic(k1ms, (i) => i).take(5);
final beacon = stream
        .toRawBeacon(isLazy: true)
        .filter((_, n) => n.isEven)
        .map((v) => v + 1)
        .throttle(duration: k1ms);

await expectLater(beacon.stream, emitsInOrder([1, 3, 5]));
```

See [docs](https://github.com/jinyus/dart_beacon?tab=readme-ov-file#mybeaconmap) for more information.

# 0.34.2

-   [Feat] Expose the list of beacons as a `Readable<List<BeaconType>>` in the family beacon's cache.

    ```dart
    final myFamily = Beacon.family((int id) => Beacon.writable(0));
    final beacons1 = family(1);

    Beacon.effect((){
        print('cache updated: ${myFamily.beacons.value}');
    });

    final beacons2 = family(2);
    // prints: cache updated: [beacons1, beacons2]
    ```

# 0.34.1

-   [Refactor] Internal refactor and minor improvement in performance

# 0.34.0

-   [Breaking] `Beacon.stream` and `Beacon.streamRaw` now takes a function that returns a stream instead of a stream directly. The upside of this change is that they are now derived beacons. All beacons accessed in the function will be tracked as dependencies. This means that if one of their dependencies changes, it will unsubscribe from the old stream and subscribe to the new one. This is a breaking change because it changes the signature of the method.

-   [Feat] Use can now manually start a stream beacon. It will start in the idle state when `manualStart` is true.

-   [Deprecated] `Beacon.derivedStream` is now deprecated. Use `Beacon.streaRaw` instead.
-   [Deprecated] `Beacon.derivedFuture` is now deprecated. Use `Beacon.future` instead.
-   [Deprecated] `Beacon.batch` is now deprecated. Batching is automatic with the [new core](#new-core).
-   [Breaking] `cancelRunning` is now removed from `FutureBeacon`. It is now the default behavior.

## New Core:

This is a major update with many breaking changes. The core of state_beacon was rewritten from scratch to be more efficient and to support more use-cases.

Pros:

-   Automatic batching
-   Asynchronous by default
-   Better performance for deep dependency trees/circular dependencies
-   Scheduler customization
    A scheduler is just a function that decides when to run all queued effects(flushing). By default, flushing is done with a microtask from DARTVM. This can be customized depending on your use case. For example, the flutter package ships with a scheduler that uses flutter's SchedulerBinding to handle flushing; as well as a 60fps scheduler that limits flushing to 60 times per second. Here is how you'd use them

```dart
BeaconScheduler.useFlutterScheduler();
BeaconScheduler.use60fpsScheduler();
```

For flutter apps, it's recommended to use the flutter scheduler. The method must be called in the main function of your app.

```dart
void main() {
 BeaconScheduler.useFlutterScheduler();

 runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

Cons:

-   Default asynchrony introduces an inconvenience with testing. Effects are queued and the scheduler decides when to flush the queue. This is ideal for apps but makes testing harder because you have to manually flush the effect queue after updating a beacon to run all effects that depends on it. This can be done by calling `BeaconScheduler.flush()` after updating the beacon.

> [!NOTE]  
> This only applies to pure dart tests. In widgets tests, calling `tester.pumpAndSettle()` will flush the queue.

```dart
final a = Beacon.writable(10);
var called = 0;

// effect is queued for execution. The scheduler decides when to run the effect
Beacon.effect(() {
      print("current value: ${a.value}");
      called++;
});

// manually flush the queue to run the all effect immediately
BeaconScheduler.flush();

expect(called, 1);

a.value = 20; // effect will be queued again.

BeaconScheduler.flush();

expect(called, 2);
```

# 0.33.6

-   [Fix] Add bug fix from 0.34.0 to flutter package

# 0.33.5

-   [Fix] Bug with auto sleeping derivedFuture beacons

# 0.33.4

-   [Fix] Concurrent modification error when notifying listeners.

# 0.33.3

-   Allow a duration to be null in `ThrottledBeacon` and `DebouncedBeacon` to disable the throttle/debouncing. This makes them easier to test.

# 0.33.2

-   [Feat] Add `Beacon.derivedStream`

Specialized `DerivedBeacon` that subscribes to the stream returned from its callback and updates its value based on the emitted values.
When a dependency changes, the beacon will unsubscribe from the old stream and subscribe to the new one.

Example:

```dart
final userID = Beacon.writable<int>(18235);
final profileBeacon = Beacon.derivedStream(() {
 return getProfileStreamFromUID(userID.value);
});
```

# 0.33.1

-   [Fix] All delegated writes will be forced to account for the fact that rollback isn't possible.

# 0.33.0

-   [Feat] Chaining beacons is now supported. When the beacon returned from a chain is mutated, the mutation is re-routed to the first beacon in the chain.

```dart
final query = Beacon.writable('');

const k500ms = Duration(milliseconds: 500);

final debouncedQuery = query
        .filter((prev, next) => next.length > 2)
        .debounce(duration: k500ms);
```

When `debouncedQuery` is mutated, the mutation is re-routed to `query`, then `filter` and finally `debounce`.

NB: Buffered beacons cannot be mid-chain. If they are used, they must be the last beacon in the chain.

```dart
// GOOD
someBeacon.filter().buffer(10);

// BAD
someBeacon.buffer(10).filter();
```

# 0.32.2

-   Allow `initialValue` to be passed to `ingest` method

# 0.32.1

-   [Feat] Any writable can now wrap a stream with the new .ingest() method.

    ```dart
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    myBeacon.ingest(anyStream);
    ```

-   [Feat] `RawStreamBeacon`s can now be initialized lazily by setting the `isLazy` option to true.

# 0.32.0

-   [Feat] Add `.stream` getter for all beacons
-   [Deprecation] `toStream()` is now deprecated. Use `.stream` instead.

    ```dart
    // before
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    final myStream = myBeacon.toStream();

    // after
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    final myStream = myBeacon.stream;
    ```

# 0.31.2

-   [Perf] This is an internal change. Only create 1 `StreamController` per beacon.
-   [Deprecation] The `broadcast` option for `toStream()` is now deprecated as it's now redundant.

    ```dart
    // before
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    final myStream = myBeacon.toStream(broadcast: true);

    // after
    final myBeacon = Beacon.writable(0);
    final myStream = myBeacon.toStream();
    ```

# 0.31.1

-   [Fix] mirror force option of wrapped beacons.

# 0.31.0

-   [Breaking] Derived and DerivedFuture beacons will now enter a sleep state when a widget/effect watching it is unmounted/disposed.

    Currently derived & derivedFuture beacons always execute even if it has no listeners.
    It will now enter a sleep state when nothing is watching it.

    Pro: No unneeded computation so it saves battery life.
    Con: It will not have the latest state when a widget starts watching it again so it will be in the loading state when woken up.

    It is configurable with a `shouldSleep` option which defaults to true.

    NB: It still start eagerly, the above only kicks in when listeners decrease from 1 to 0. If you want a lazy start, just declare it as a late variable.

    ```dart
    // with late keyword, someFuture won't run until stats is used.
    late final stats = Beacon.derivedFuture(() async => someFuture());
    ```

# 0.30.0

-   [Feat] Add BeaconGroup that allows you to group beacons together and dispose/reset them all at once.

    ```dart
    final myGroup = BeaconGroup();

    final name = myGroup.writable('Bob');
    final age = myGroup.writable(20);

    age.value = 21;
    name.value = 'Alice';

    myGroup.resetAll();

    print(name.value); // Bob
    print(age.value); // 20

    myGroup.disposeAll();

    print(name.isDisposed); // true
    print(age.isDisposed); // true
    ```

-   [Fix] resetting an uninitialized lazybeacon no longer throws an error.

# 0.29.3

-   [Feat] Add ability to do optimistic update when using AsyncValue.tryCatch()

# 0.29.2

-   Internal refactor that enables deeply nested untracked withing nested effects. This is just covers a rare edge case and should not affect any existing code.

# 0.29.1

-   [Refactor] Internal refactor to improve performance

# 0.29.0

-   [Breaking] `toStream()` now has a broadcast option that defaults to false. This is a breaking change because it changes the default behavior of `toStream()`. If you want to keep the old behavior, set `broadcast` to true.

# 0.28.0

-   Internal refactor

# 0.27.0

-   [Breaking] rename `debugLabel` to `name`

# 0.26.0

-   [Breaking] beacons **NO** longer implements ValueListenable. Use `mybeacon.toListenable()` as a replacement. This was done because implementing ValueListenable necessitated importing the flutter package which isn't usable in pure dart projects.

## Everything below was written before the state_beacon -> state_beacon_core migration

The core of state_beacon was extracted into a separate package to make it usuable in pure dart projects.

# 0.25.0

-   [Deprecation] `Beacon.createEffect`. Use `Beacon.effect` instead.
-   [Deprecation] `Beacon.doBatchUpdate`. Use `Beacon.batch` instead.
-   Add `reset` for list,set and map beacons.
-   add `isEmpty` getter that returns true if a lazy beacon is uninitialized.
-   Internal refactor

# 0.24.0

-   [Breaking] Convenience wrapping methods: `.buffer()`, `.bufferTime()`, `.throttle()` and `.filter()` etc no longer needs an initial value. It fetches its initial value from the target beacon if `startNow` is true (which is the default).

# 0.23.0

-   [Breaking] beacon.wrap() no longer returns the wrapper instance. This is redundant as it retuned the same instance that the method was called on. Chanining can be achieved by using `beacon..wrap()..wrap()`

# 0.22.1

-   Add `disposeTogether` option for beacon wrapping. This will dispose all wrapped beacons when the wrapping beacon is disposed and vice versa. It's set the `false` for manual wrapping and `true` when using extension methods like `mybeacon.buffer(10)`

# 0.22.0

-   [Breaking] initialValue is now a named argument for all beacon _classes_. This doesn't affect any existing public api provided by `Beacon.writable()` etc. This only affects you if you are using the `Beacon` class directly.

# 0.21.0

-   [Breaking] Separate `idle` and `loading` states for the `isLoading` getter in `AsyncValue`. Use `isIdleOrLoading` for the old behavior.
-   [Fix] BufferedBeacon.reset() no longer unsubscribes from the wrapped beacon.

# 0.20.1

-   Stacktrace is now optional in AsyncError contructor. StackTrace.current is used if it is not provided.

# 0.20.0

-   [Feat] Add effect actions to Observer and debuglabel for effects.
-   [Feat] A function can be returned from effect closures that will be called when the effect is disposed. This can be used to clean up sub effects.
-   [Fix] Effects no longer do additional passes to discover new beacons when supportCOnditional is false;
-   [Breaking] `isNullable` is no longer exposed
-   [Breaking] remove `reset` from stream and readable beacons.
-   [Breaking] remove `start` from derived beacon. Use late initialization instead.

-   [Feat] Add `.buffer()` that returns a [BufferedCountBeacon] that wraps this Beacon.
-   [Feat] Add `.bufferTime()` that returns a [BufferedTimeBeacon] that wraps this Beacon.
-   [Feat] Add `.throttle()` that returns a [ThrottledBeacon] that wraps this Beacon.
-   [Feat] Add `.filter()` that returns a [FilteredBeacon] that wraps this Beacon.
